## Why I want to build this personal website?

- Obviously, it's meant to be a quick introduction to people who don't know me well, like professors, hr, you... It's often more direct and three-dimensional than a simple resume.
- Record my growth. I used to keep a diary, but now I prefer to record it digitally.
## What I want to do in the future?
- Before I went to college, I wanted to be a math teacher, and I thought it would be fun to summarize a topic or a class of topics and share him with my classmates. I'm not a very talented person, there are a lot of things that I wasn't born knowing, but I love summarizing, and even more, I love the sense of accomplishment it gives me.
- When I enter universuty I want to be a scientific engineer, writing code & creating new things excites me. During my undergraduate studies I marveled at the impact that computers have had on the world at large, with new technologies and epoch-making theories being born all the time. This was felt very deeply when I read the top conference articles, and it also gave me a first-hand sense of the ever-changing nature of the rise of AI, with iterations occurring at a rate that amazes me.
- Now I realize that there are times when being a teacher and doing research can turn out to be the same thing, and it turns out that the professor in front of me is what I called a scientist when I was a kid. Perhaps, after walking with my head down for a long time, thinking about what I want is the key.
## What motivates me
- A large part of my motivation to do something comes from the sense of accomplishment that comes with the realization of personal value. A sense of accomplishment is something I found to be a rarity after I went to college. When I was a kid, learning how to shoot cards gave me a sense of accomplishment. In elementary school, learning to get a medal in track and field gave me a sense of accomplishment, and in middle school, getting a perfect score in math gave me a sense of accomplishment. In college, the sources of fulfillment seemed to become fewer. I want to be someone who has the ability to make a difference, and it's so nebulous if going to whatever school proves what kind of person I am. Maybe I didn't know myself before, I didn't know what I should do if I wanted to achieve something, I didn't know how to make people comfortable with each other, I didn't know how to reconcile with unpleasant things, I didn't know how to stand up after my faith and worldview have been shattered. Afterwards, in thinking about this over and over again I think I have a big late-stage personality and gain a sense of control over my life.
- What has doing research brought me? A paper with my name on it? Actually, it is much more than a thesis. Doing research makes me feel that I am working and not a student in the traditional sense. If I were to do what I did in the past, I would have been able to discard my sense of life and not be creative for the sake of high scores on exams and GPAs. But this is not the case with research and thesis writing, which requires “Tian Shi Di Li Ren He”, just like playing a game, it is hard to predict what will be in the next level and the next bush. I enjoy the positive signals that effort brings to me. Humanity is the source of creativity, and it allows me to respect and understand myself, and to retain my sense of life and inspiration, so that I don't become sluggish in my research.
